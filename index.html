   <p>So here it is, the main character - Madeline!</p>
   By the way if u don't want to hear some spoilers from me, you can just go and buy that game directly in 
   <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.
   I bought it when it was on a sale, and it cost only 69 hryvnas, and this game deserves more than just 2 dollars!
